# which relate the motion of the robot $(\mathit{q}, \mathit{\dot{q}}, \mathit{\ddot{q}})$ and the applied torque $\mathit{\tau}$.  The coefficients in this equation are:
# - the inertia or mass matrix $\mathbf{M}(\mathit{\ddot{q}})$ which is a function of joint configuration
# - the centripetal and Coriolis or velocity term which is a function of joint configuration and rate
# - the gravity load which is a function of joint configuration
#
# If the robot is not moving, that is $\mathit{q} = \mathit{\dot{q}} = 0$ then the equation becomes

# \mathbf{g}(\mathit{q}) = \mathit{\tau}

# where $\mathit{\tau}$ is the torque required for this condition $\mathit{q} = \mathit{\dot{q}} = 0$ to be true, that is, the torque required to stop the robot falling under its own weight.  The toolbox can compute this

# and it shows, as expected, that the shoulder is exerting significant torque to hold the arm up and stationary.

# The diagonal elements $M_{jj}$ indicate the inertia experienced by the joint $j$, ie. Newton's second law for this joint is $\tau_j  = M_{jj} \ddot{q}_j$.
#
# The matrix is symmetric and the off-diagonal terms $M_{ij} = M_{ji}$ couple acceleration of one joint into a disturbance torque on another joint, ie.  $\tau_j = M_{ij} \ddot{q}_i$.
#
# The inertia matrix is a function of joint configuration, that is, the elements of the inertia matrix change as we vary the angles of joints 1 and 2, ie. $q_2$ and $q_3$.  It is this configuration varying inertia and coupling between joints that is a fundamental challenge for high-quality joint control.

# The first line needs some explanation.  The Toolbox can model two types of joint friction:
# - viscous friction which is linearly related to joint velocity
# - Coulomb friction which is **non-linearly** related to joint velocity
#
# Coulomb friction is a _harsh_ non-linearity and it causes the numerical integrator to take very small times steps, so the result will take many minutes to compute.  To speed things up, at the expense of some modeling fidelity, we set the Coulomb friction to zero, but retain the viscous friction.  The `nofriction()` method returns a clone of the robot with its friction parameters modified.

# The motion of the robot quickly dies out and it hangs downward, this loss of energy is due to the viscous friction in the robot's joints.
